Dataset Description:

Cleaned dataset, moderate difficulty

The dataset provides information on flight departures, encompassing attributes such as the month, day of the month, day of the week, scheduled departure time, unique carrier code, origin airport code, destination airport code, and distance in miles. This dataset enables analysis and exploration of flight operations, including patterns and trends in flight scheduling, carrier performance, and distances traveled. With this dataset, researchers can gain insights into the temporal and spatial aspects of flight departures, facilitating the understanding of airline operations and the evaluation of factors that influence flight logistics and efficiency.

ML Algorithms:

1. Regression Algorithms: You can use regression algorithms such as Linear Regression, Random Forest Regression, or Gradient Boosting Regression to predict the flight departure time (DepTime) based on other features like Month, DayofMonth, DayOfWeek, UniqueCarrier, Origin, Dest, and Distance.
2. Classification Algorithms: If you have a target variable indicating a specific category or class, you can use classification algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, or Support Vector Machines to classify flights based on features such as Month, DayofMonth, DayOfWeek, UniqueCarrier, Origin, Dest, and Distance. For example, you could predict whether a flight will be delayed or not.
3. Clustering Algorithms: Clustering algorithms such as K-means or DBSCAN can be used to group flights based on their characteristics, such as Month, DayofMonth, DayOfWeek, UniqueCarrier, Origin, Dest, and Distance. This can help identify patterns or similarities among flights without a predefined target variable.
