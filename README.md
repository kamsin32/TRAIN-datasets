# TRAIN Datasets

### This repo is for storing datasets that we can use when creating problems for TRAIN. 
 
Instead of using the sklearn datasets repeatedly, these datasets can be useful when practicing different models for labs and homeworks.

They are uploaded here for easy access when creating a colab. Check the accompanying dictionary for information on *what types of models they are usable for*, the columns names/info, and any additional helpful information. 

If you want to use the links included in the dictionary, *download the PDF* and then you should be able to click on any links embedded.

A spreadsheet with information on which dataset can be used with what models can be found here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gHRwt7FO3a9HIeLHbS8BwBTv2iAr9573yLWl8f1TbXo/edit?usp=sharing. ***If you add any datasets, please update the spreadsheet!***
