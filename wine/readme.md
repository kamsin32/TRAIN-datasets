Dataset description:

Cleaned dataset, moderate difficulty

The wine dataset consists of various features related to the chemical composition of wines, including fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, chlorides, free sulfur dioxide, total sulfur dioxide, density, pH, sulphates, alcohol content, and quality. The dataset also includes an "Id" column that serves as a unique identifier for each entry.

The features in the dataset provide information about different chemical properties of wines that can be used to predict their quality. Fixed acidity represents the non-volatile acids in the wine, volatile acidity indicates the presence of volatile acids, citric acid represents the citric acid content, and residual sugar refers to the amount of sugar left in the wine after fermentation. Chlorides represent the salt content, while free sulfur dioxide and total sulfur dioxide represent the amount of sulfur dioxide in the wine, which acts as a preservative.

Density is a measure of the wine's density relative to water, pH indicates the acidity or alkalinity of the wine, and sulphates represent the sulfur content in the wine. Alcohol content indicates the percentage of alcohol in the wine. The quality column represents a rating or score assigned to each wine sample, indicating its perceived quality.
