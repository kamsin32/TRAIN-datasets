## Dataset Description:
This is the data repository for the 2019 Novel Coronavirus Visual Dashboard operated by the Johns Hopkins University
Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CSSE). Also, Supported by ESRI Living Atlas Team and the Johns Hopkins
University Applied Physics Lab (JHU APL). As the outbreak evolved, the manual reporting process became unsustainable, and on February 1, 
the developers adopted a semi-automated living data stream strategy. Their primary data source was initially DXY, an online platform run by members of 
the Chinese medical community, which aggregates local media and government reports to provide COVID-19 cumulative case totals in near real-time
at the province level in China and country level otherwise. As the outbreak spread outside of China, the set of data sources providing the most 
reliable and timely case data evolved. They regularly update, replace and supplement the set of data sources they relied on. Currently, DXY,
remains the primary source of case data for all provinces in Mainland China, as well as Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan. Additional data sources are 
relied upon for reporting on regions outside China inclduing U.S. county and state health departments, multiple national government health
departments, as well as data aggregating websites including 1point3acres, Worldometers.info, BNO,and the COVID Tracking Project (testing and hospitalizations), 
which rely on a combination of reporting from local health departments and local media reports. The full list of sources is maintained on their CSSE 
COVID19 GitHub Repository. All dashboard data curation and updates are coordinated by a team at JHU.
