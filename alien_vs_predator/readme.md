Dataset Description:

The provided zip file contains a collection of training and testing images related to the themes of aliens and predators. Each image has been labeled as either "alien" or "predator". 

ML Algorithms:

1. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): CNNs are widely used for image classification tasks. They are designed to automatically learn and extract features from images, making them well-suited for identifying patterns and distinguishing between aliens and predators.
